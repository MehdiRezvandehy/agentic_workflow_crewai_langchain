# agentic_workflow_crewai_langchain

CrewAI is designed around the idea of collaborative, role-based AI agents â€” hence the name "Crew," highlighting teamwork. Each agent is assigned a specific role, enabling them to work together to solve complex tasks. Unlike single-agent frameworks, CrewAI supports inter-agent communication and dynamic task delegation, allowing tasks to be intelligently split and shared. In this notebook, we demonstrated how to use CrewAI agents both with and without a manager, integrated web search capabilities using LangChain and SerpAPI, and generated personalized messages based on the gathered information.
